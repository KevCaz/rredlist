## Test environments

* ubuntu 16.04 (on travis-ci), R 4.0.3
* win-builder (evel and release)

## R CMD check results

0 errors | 0 warnings | 0 notes

## Reverse dependencies

* I have run R CMD check on the 1 downstream dependeny. There is one error in the reverse dependency taxize, but it's a simple check of a URL returned that has changed because the base url for the API wrapped in this package has changed. A fix is ready in the reverse dependency taxize and will be submitted soon. Summary at:

This version makes minor improvements to documentation.
